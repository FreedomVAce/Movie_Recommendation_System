## Introduction
How do find new movies to watch? More often than not, either someone recommends a movie to us or we look for online recommendations like Netfilx or Youtube. The recommendation system have become such important tools to our living, and we probably don't even realize their existence. The point of this project is to show and understand how the recommendation systems work. Also, I need some movies to kill time during this quarantine period. So, I applied machine learning techniques to build the recommendation systems. 
 
## Kaggle Dataset Information

These files contain metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset. The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages.

This dataset also has files containing 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website.
